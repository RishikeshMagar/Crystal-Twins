# Crystal Twins 
This is the code repository for the work the work Crystal Twins: Self-supervised Learning for Crystalline Material Property Prediction. In this work we develop a SSL framework for material property prediction.

We developed a framework for SSL learning for crystalline materials. Our method is based on the Barlow Twins Loss Function and the SimSimaese Network.

## Benchmark
The CGCNN model we pretrained using SSL has been tested on the Matbench datasets and the some of the databases from Materials Project. We have made the pretrained models available for general use. The model was pretrained on the Matminer database and the hMOF database. In total, we had 428K crystalline materials for training the ML model.
